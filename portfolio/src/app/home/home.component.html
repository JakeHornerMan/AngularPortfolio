                        In MasterCard, I hold the position of Software Engineer II, where I work towards the development and maintenance of the In-Control Commercial Payments (ICCP) Platform, an active platform built with Java, Spring Framework, and Angular frontend. I have been actively involved in the Smart Data Project, a ‘Business-to-Business’ software solution for controlling payments for generated virtual cards.

                        I have made considerable contributions to developing web services for a health check system active in this platform with Java EE and Spring Framework, creating endpoints that will be consumed by both customers and internal teams.

                <h2>High Impact Contributions</h2>

                                    Health Check Separation
                                </mat-panel-title>
                            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                            <p>
                                The health check system was an endpoint that allowed internal and external customers to check the status of the ICCP application. This functionality was split into endpoints, shallow health returning a simple “status: UP” or “status: DOWN”, and deep health returning an in-depth analysis of all components relating to the ICCP application. These 2 endpoints would gather this information from cached values stored and logged by a background service every 30 seconds.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was tasked with separating these two endpoints functionality, and making them have independent run times for caching and logging, 5 seconds for shallow, and 5 minutes for deep. Also, I was tasked with having the shallow endpoint return the cached value, while the deep endpoint would run the health check service independently and return the current status values.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I focused on the separation of the Heath check service into two by creating a DeepHealthService class and a ShallowHealthService class, also creating independent flags and variables to support this separation. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I used multithreading to create another scheduling task, that will be running DeepHealthService. I also created another cache store and logging functionality, for this value to be stored every 5 minutes. The previous thread handling the old implementation of health check service, was then repurposed to run the ShallowHealthService.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Finally, I pointed the deep endpoint that accessed the cached value, to now do an independent call to my DeepHealthService, and return this value to the end user.

                                There are many different applications that come together to make up the ICCP Platform. When each application contacts the other they have a passphrase type validation to verify that another application is from the MasterCard suite of applications. My Team, Team Vision was in charge of migrating this system to a new solution HashiCorp Vault. We were in charge of migrating CommercialAPI, PurchaseControlUI, CommercialApi Batch, and CommercialApi Report.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Mastercard has many different environments where applications are deployed and tested, Stage 1, Stage 2, Performance testing, MTF, MTF2. On top of these servers, we also need to migrate the servers based in the United States and India. We were provided with a ‘Cookbook solution’ by an alternative team on basic settings and procedures we should be doing to migrate servers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a Team, we had to develop a set of Instructions and Validations that needed to be carried out by members of Mastercard (BizOps) who have in-depth access to all server and Jenkins configurations. We created Pull Requests for each environment, that merged the new Hashi configurations on each of these specific servers. When these instructions were finalised, we needed to create a CRQ session with BizOps to carry out our steps and validations.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A major part I played in the Hashi Migration CRQ sessions with BizOps, was for the 8 servers in India. Mastercard cycles between an Active server set each weekend, 2 sets for 4 application. Due to our ICCP platform being a business solution, the best time to do this migration was on the weekend. We did the inactive set of 4 servers on Saturday, steps for migration, and validated the application functionality. That evening an alternative team performed with a cutover of making the migrated Hashi servers active, while also making the remaining 4 servers inactive. We then proceeded with the Hashi migration of the inactive servers on Sunday.

                        I was employed by Ergo, as a contractor for the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) to work on an emerging web application for the Irish Financial market, the SBCI customer hub. This application is a way for small businesses to access support for reduced-rate loans, allow for on-lenders to view and access these loan applications, and a system for the internal SBCI team to accept or deny these funding opportunities.

                                There were several different loan schemes available for customers using the SBCI customer hub, where a user could select and fill out various pages to see if they were eligible for a reduced-rate loan. When a user selects a scheme it has a hard-coded set of eight pages that would need to be completed in order to apply for that loan. The introduction of the ‘Ukraine Credit Guarantee Scheme’ aimed at providing financial aid to businesses affected by the Ukraine crisis, the business needs required a new page progression to calculate if a customer was eligible for a subsidized loan.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I created a new component that allows the loan application to take in the scheme name and populate the application with the necessary components, decouple the stepper functionality from the to allow it to be populated with the passed-on information, and also allow for reused pages from other schemes to be populated with necessary legal text for it to be used in multiple scheme types.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This system has been continued, and used to support many different loan application schemes.

                                Before the release of the Customer Hub application, a major target for us was to restructure the design to fit all devices and be responsive to all screen sizes. When I joined the team I led the process with our UX designer to form a system using Flexbox CSS. Our goal was to keep the original design flow and philosophy while allowing smaller devices to be visible and intuitive.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I created a clear class-based system that allowed us to cut down on rewriting CSS code for each Angular component. We could then call clearly defined CSS classes and modifiers to allow each box of content to scale and restructure to allow the end user to access the app on any device. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Before release, we managed to restructure all of the customer-facing pages which include the login, loan application process pages, and the main menu with sub-menus. After release, we continued to bring the Flexbox CSS system to all other users including on lender and approvers.

                        Usheru is a film industry marketing and web services company, they provide many web solutions for film festivals, cinema ticketing services, and film online marketing. I was taken on as a Software Development Intern for six months. Here, I mainly worked on an application that was used to generate web pages and services that would provide ticket booking and show times. This application was created using Java, and we did some work on the generated pages using custom HTML and CSS.

                                In Usheru a lot of information was scraped from the web to keep their internal ticketing system functional, this would be done through a shell script that would give output in the console if each process was successful. The information taken varied from showtimes, ticket numbers, seat information, streaming services, and review ratings. The issue with the current implementation was that it was only visible to the developers on the Usheru team if these processes had been run successfully or not.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I was tasked with creating a page for an internal admin user at usheru called ‘TaskLogs’, this contained various information for each task run by the information gathering shell script such as start time, end time, total time, did it completed successfully, how many records did it gather, and a JSON file output to see the record gathered.

                        The Albany Beck Pioneers Program was a six-month intensive training program, which I attended directly after finishing my degree at The National College of Ireland. The aim of the program was to teach Java EE, SQL, and Spring Framework to graduates looking for employment in the technology industry.

                        Albany Beck had a main focus on the financial industry and would provide us with interview opportunities with various UK financial services.

                    <p>
                        During training, we focused on the beginning of Java development, object-oriented programming, databases, database management, Spring Boot, Microservices with Spring Web, Authentication with Spring Security, Spring JDBC, and Spring MVC. Throughout the training we created many applications, with a final project created in the last week, which was a trading application. This application is documented on the ‘Software Projects Tab’ under the name ‘Stock Trading Web Application’.

                            The player’s car is controlled by rotating the phone left or right to change lanes. The player can also shoot at any oncoming enemy car to gain points and dispatch them.

                        Shy Chomper is an action stealth puzzle game, where the player avoids the gaze of the enemy ‘Blobbers’, and ‘Floating Eyes’. The player can only cross tiles marked by a specific color, by consuming a ‘Blobbler’ of the corresponding color.

The application was created with a team of four, which was led by me, during my time in the Albany Beck’s Pioneer Program. The application was created to simulate online stock traders/clients, where users can place orders (BUY & SELL) for trading, view their order status, view the trade order history, and access their asset purchases in the wallet.

                        This was a team submission to GMTK Game Jam 2024, which placed 263rd out of nearly 7000 submitted games. The theme of the Game Jam was “roles reversed”, so we decided to do a reverse on the game ‘Crossy Road’. In ‘Crossy Road’, the player's aim is to control a chicken to get across a road, in our demo ‘Scrambled Eggs’ the player will place cars to stop waves of chicken from crossing the Road. We expanded on this idea with different car types and different chicken types.

We plan to release it on PC and  Mobile.
